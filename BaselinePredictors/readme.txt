These programs were written in Java. They take in a text file and output text 
files for (hopefully) more convenient planning. Due to data privacy concerns, 
I have not included the input or output files with my code. Email me if you 
want them.

Please make sure to change the filepaths at the top of the appropriate 
****App.java file if you want to try it on your own system. I tried to comment
everything as thoroughly as possible, but feel free to let me know if anything
doesn't make sense.

In the current code, option 6 (user rating drifts over time) hasn't been 
implemented yet. I'll try to get that done asap.

If you don't want to run the code / can't, just tell me or send me which files
you want to run on, and I'll do it can send you the output textfile.
