These programs were written in Java. They take in a text file and output text 
files for (hopefully) more convenient sharing. Due to data privacy and size 
concerns, I have not included the input or output files with my code. Email
me if you want them.

KNN_TROVE and KNNApp differ in that I used the KNN_TROVE libraries to reduce
memory consumption. I would estimate that it cut down consumption by 30%, 
making it feasible to run on a 8gb RAM computer. 

Please make sure to change the filepaths at the top of the appropriate 
****App.java file if you want to try it on your own system. Organizationally, 
the ****App.java is the top caller, which calls on ****Task.java files to 
complete the specified task. I tried to comment everything as thoroughly as
possible, but feel free to let me know if anything doesn't make sense.

If you don't want to run the code / can't, just tell me or send me which files
you want to run on, and I'll do it and will send you the output textfile.
